# This file defines the processes that will be run on Heroku.
# Each line must be in the format `<process type>: <command>`.
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/how-heroku-works#knowing-what-to-execute
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile

# The `release` process type specifies the command to run during deployment, and is where
# we run DB migrations and other tasks that are 'release' rather than 'build' specific:
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/release-phase
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/runtime-principles#build-release-run
release: ./bin/pre_deploy

# The `web` process type is the only one that receives external traffic from Heroku's routers.
# We set the maximum request duration to 20 seconds, to ensure that poorly performing API
# queries do not consume a gunicorn worker for unbounded lengths of time. See:
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-gunicorn
# The Heroku Python buildpack sets some sensible gunicorn defaults via environment variables:
# https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python/blob/master/vendor/python.gunicorn.sh
# https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python/blob/master/vendor/WEB_CONCURRENCY.sh
# TODO: Experiment with different dyno sizes and gunicorn concurrency/worker types (bug 1175472).
web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn treeherder.config.wsgi:application --timeout 20

# All other process types can have arbitrary names.
# The Celery options such as `--without-heartbeat` are from the recommendations here:
# https://www.cloudamqp.com/docs/celery.html
# The REMAP_SIGTERM is as recommended by:
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/celery-heroku#using-remap_sigterm

# This schedules (but does not run itself) the cron-like tasks listed in `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE`.
# However we're moving away from using this in favour of the Heroku scheduler addon.
# NB: This should not be scaled up to more than 1 dyno otherwise duplicate tasks will be scheduled.
# TODO: Move the remaining tasks to the addon and remove this process type (deps of bug 1176492).

# Push/job data is consumed from exchanges on pulse.mozilla.org using these kombu-powered
