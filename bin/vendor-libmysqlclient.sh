# The latest versions of libmysqlclient 5.5/5.6 (used by mysqlclient) are still
# vulnerable to TLS stripping, even after last year's backports of 5.7.x fixes:
#   - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3152
#   - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1289156
#   - http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=82383
#
# Ideally we'd just use the standalone Connector/C library instead of the
# libmysqlclient packages, however the latest release is too old:
#   - http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=82448
#
# Heroku's cedar-14 stack comes with libmysqlclient 5.5.x, so until it is updated
# to 5.7.x (https://github.com/heroku/stack-images/pull/38) we must manually vendor
# 5.7.X ourselves, so that connections between the Heroku dynos and our public RDS
# instances are secure. We can do this and still remain on MySQL server 5.6, since
# newer client releases are backwards compatible with older server versions.
#
# Whilst the Vagrant/Travis MySQL instances don't use TLS (and so aren't affected),
# we still want them to use libmysqlclient 5.7, to be consistent with production.
#
# Usage:
#    ./bin/vendor-libmysqlclient.sh "foo/vendor-dir"
#
# NB: The `foo/vendor-dir/bin` directory must be on the PATH ahead of `/usr/bin`
# during pip install (so mysqlclient finds `mysql_config`), and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
# must include `foo/vendor-dir/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` at Python runtime.

# Make non-zero exit codes & other errors fatal.
