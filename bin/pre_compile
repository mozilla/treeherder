# The existing value for `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` only includes `$VENDOR_DIR/lib` and not
# also the `x86_64-linux-gnu` directory that the libmysqlclient package will create
# inside it. Directories in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are not searched recursively and we
# cannot add additional directories, since `pre_compile` is run in a sub-shell. In
# addition, `vendor-libmysqlclient.sh` cannot flatten the directory structure,
# since `mysql_config` uses relative paths that include `x86_64-linux-gnu`.
# As such, we have to create a symlink to ensure the library is found at runtime.
