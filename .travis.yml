# Do not run these on the travis server at this time.
# The end to end tests require the service to be running, but travis can't
# start the service for us.  So we would have to have the default point to
# a dedicated dev service instance that is reach-able by travis.  However, we
# require /etc/hosts to have an entry at this point to reach our current dev
# server.  So these tests should be run only locally for now.
