# part of Heroku's build step when the code has already been merged to master.

# to build both the JS and Python builds
# In Heroku, the JS dev dependencies are *not* installed because the env variable
# YARN_PRODUCTION is detected by the buildpack, however, yarn does not care about
# that and needs an explicit flag (`--prod`)
