# since doc generation does not need all of the requirements in common.txt.
# This file is used by Read the Docs, Travis and when building locally.

sphinx-autobuild==0.7.1
sphinx-rtd-theme==0.4.1
# Installing from GitHub since the version on PyPI is 2 years old:
# https://github.com/rtfd/recommonmark/issues/92
# ...and we need the fix for:
# https://github.com/rtfd/recommonmark/issues/51
# Editable mode is required to force the latest version to be
# installed, since Read The Docs doesn't use --upgrade and has an
# older incompatible version of recommonmark pre-installed.
