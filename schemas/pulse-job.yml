      Labels are a dimension of a platform.  The values here can vary wildly,
      so most strings are valid for this.  The list of labels that are used
      is maleable going forward.

      These were formerly known as "Options" within "Option Collections" but
      calling labels now so they can be understood to be just strings that
      denotes a characteristic of the job.

      Some examples of labels that have been used:
        opt    Optimize Compiler GCC optimize flags
        debug  Debug flags passed in
        pgo    Profile Guided Optimization - Like opt, but runs with profiling, then builds again using that profiling
        asan   Address Sanitizer
        tsan   Thread Sanitizer Build
