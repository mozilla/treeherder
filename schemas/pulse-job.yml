      Options are a dimension of a platform.  The values here can vary wildly,
      so most strings are valid for this.  The list of options that are used
      is maleable going forward.

      Some examples of options that have been used:
        opt    Optimize Compiler GCC optimize flags
        debug  Debug flags passed in
        pgo    Profile Guided Optimization - Like opt, but runs with profiling, then builds again using that profiling
        asan   Address Sanitizer
        tsan   Thread Sanitizer Build
