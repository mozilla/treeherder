Reproducing and debugging the regression:

If you would like to re-run this Talos test on a potential fix, use try with the following syntax:

try: -b o -p {{ tryBuildPlatforms }} -u none -t {{ trySuites }} --rebuild 5  # add "mozharness: --spsProfile" to generate profile data

(we suggest --rebuild 5 to be more confident in the results)

To run the test locally and do a more in-depth investigation, first set up a local Talos environment:

https://wiki.mozilla.lorg/Buildbot/Talos/Running#Running_locally_-_Source_Code

Then run the following command from the directory where you set up Talos:

talos --develop -e <path>/firefox -a {{ talosTestListSyntax }}

(add --e10s to run tests in e10s mode)
