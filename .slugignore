# Files/directories to be excluded from the Heroku build, to reduce
# the resultant slug size and thus speed up dyno deploys. See:
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler#ignoring-files-with-slugignore
# Anything not committed to version control (for example `node_modules`)
# is automatically excluded so does not need to be listed here.
