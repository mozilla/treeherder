#
# 1. failJobs: These are jobs where this test has specifically failed in the job
#    (it has a FailureLine record with the tests name).
# 2. passJobs: These are jobs where this test was run and all tests, including this one, passed.
#    (The job is green.)
# 3. passInFailedJobs: These are jobs that overall came back as 'testfailed', however, the
#    test in question did NOT fail (we have no FailureLine record matching this test).  So, even
#    though the job failed, we count it as a 'pass' for the test in question.  This 'pass' is
#    used for the pass/fail ratio on the test to help determine if it is intermittent.
