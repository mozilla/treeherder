    Returns the TLS version of a Heroku REDIS_URL string.

    Whilst Redis server (like memcached) doesn't natively support TLS, Heroku runs an stunnel
    daemon on their Redis instances, which can be connected to directly by Redis clients that
    support TLS (avoiding the need for stunnel on the client). The stunnel port is one higher
    than the Redis server port, and the informal `rediss://` scheme used to instruct clients
    to wrap the connection with TLS.

    Will convert 'redis://h:PASSWORD@INSTANCE.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8409'
          ...to: 'rediss://h:PASSWORD@INSTANCE.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8410?ssl_cert_reqs=none'
