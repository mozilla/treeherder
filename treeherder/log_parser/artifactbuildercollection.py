Run a log through a collection of Artifact Builders to generate artifacts.


Architecture
============

ArtifactBuilderCollection
------------------
* Holds one or more instances of ``ArtifactBuilderBase``
* If ``builders`` passed in, uses those as the artifact
builders, otherwise creates the default artifact builders.
* Reads the log from the log handle/url and walks each line
calling into each artifact builder with each line for handling
* Maintains no state


ArtifactBuilderBase
-------------
* Base class for all artifact builders`.
* Manages:
* artifact
* line number
* parser
* Passes lines the ``Parser``

BuildbotLogViewArtifactBuilder
-------------
* Parses out content for use in a visual Log Parser
* Parsers:
* StepParser, which has its own ErrorParser

BuildbotJobArtifactBuilder
-------------
* Builds an artifact for the Treeherder job details panel
* Parsers:
* TinderboxPrintParser

BuildbotPerformanceDataArtifactBuilder
-------------
* Builds an artifact from performance data
* Parsers:
* PerformanceParser
