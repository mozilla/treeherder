# `--no-bin-links` is required when using Vagrant on Windows hosts (where symlinks aren't

# Don't run preinstall/install/postinstall hooks during yarn install, since:
#  - most are not actually required
#  - they often don't work with --no-bin-links (the bin scripts called may not exist)
#  - they cause Yarn to "unplug" the package when using the "Plug and Play" feature
#  - it's more secure to not run arbitrary code during package installation
