REST API
========

Treeherder provides a REST API which can be used to query for all the
resultset, job, and performance data it stores internally. To allow
inspection of this API, we use Swagger_, which provides a friendly
browsable interface to Treeherder's API endpoints. After setting up a
local instance of treeherder, you can access Swagger at
http://local.treeherder.mozilla.org/docs/. You can also view it on
our production instance at https://treeherder.mozilla.org/docs/.
