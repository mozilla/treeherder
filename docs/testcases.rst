See also the Treeherder `userguide`_ for URL Query String Parameters. Please test variants and perform exploratory testing as top/bottom of range is new functionality (Jun 3, 15')
Navigate to the 2nd resultset loaded, from the resultset action menu select 'Set as top of range'.

    **Expected**: Ensure: (1) 1st resultset is omitted (2) url contains `&tochange=SHA` and (3) ten resultsets are loaded from that new top

Navigate to the 3rd resultset loaded and select 'Set as bottom of range'

    **Expected**: Ensure (1) only the 3 ranged resultsets are loaded (2) url contains '&tochange=[top-SHA]&fromchange=[bottom-SHA]'

Click Get Next | 10 in the page footer.

Filter resultsets by URL date range
------
See also the Treeherder `userguide`_ for URL Query String Parameters
Add a revision range to the URL in the format, eg:

&startdate=2015-09-28&enddate=2015-09-28

Warning: With the latest volume of jobs and resultsets, anything greater than a single day window risks loading too much data for the browser with Treeherder default filter and exclusion settings.

    **Expected**: Resultsets loaded should honor that range.

(Optional) Wait for new pushes to that repo.

    **Expected**: Resultsets loaded should continue to honor that range.

Modify Exclusion Profiles in the Sheriff panel
------

Show/Hide excluded jobs
------
Click the open rounded-square button in the top navbar to Show/Hide excluded jobs.

    **Expected**: Confirm that jobs currently in the default exclusion profile appear when the icon is solid white (on) and disappear when off. Those jobs range from some Tier-2 jobs, Autophone, and other jobs specified in the default Exclusion Profile UI.

Perfherder Graphs
------
Load Perfherder at eg.
https://treeherder.allizom.org/perf.html

    **Expected**: Landing page should appear.

Click the blue 'Add test data' button, select a platform, enter a test series, and click Add+.

    **Expected**: Performance series should load with scatter graph and line graph.

Click Add more test data, and add a 2nd series.

    **Expected**: The second series is drawn in an alternate color, and both series can have their displays disabled/enabled via Show/Hide series tick UI.

Change display range dropdown to 90 days (or other value)

    **Expected**: Ensure both series expand to that date range. Confirm the data which has expired beyond the 6 week data cycle still appears, but the SHA just will instead display "loading revision".

No console errors throughout test run
------
Ensure the browser console is error free during and after the test run.
Open the console during the test run.

    **Expected**: No errors should appear in the console.

Perfherder Compare
------
Load Perfherder Compare at eg.
https://treeherder.allizom.org/perf.html#/comparechooser

    **Expected**: Landing page should appear.

Select two push revisions from the 'Recent' dropdowns, and click 'Compare revisions'.

    **Expected**: The count "+14" should be deselected.

Click on the ( + ) global Expand/Collapse icon in the navbar to toggle all +n counts.

    **Expected**: Counts should expand and collapse on all visible resultsets.

Navigate via the n,p and left/right keys.

    **Expected**: +n counts should be skipped during navigation.

expand all the groups, (the url querystring will reflect this) then reload the page

    **Expected**: groups should still be expanded for all resultsets
