# Treeherder Manual Smoke Tests

Quick set of tests to be run prior to:

- Merging a PR
- Deploying from [stage](https://treeherder.allizom.org) to [production](https://treeherder.mozilla.org)

For a PR, depending on what you changed, you may need to only test in one of
these categories.

4. Retrigger a job on try.
5. Add new jobs and click **Trigger** button on try.
6. Hit `n` key to select next failed job. Hit again should cycle through each.
7. Change filtering to ensure they take effect.
