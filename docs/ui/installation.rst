Installation
============

You can work on the UI without needing a VM, by using web-server.js.
There are a few limitations, such as Persona login not working (`bug 1168797`_), but it works well enough for quick testing. For instructions on how to serve the UI with working URL rewriting, see the Vagrant instructions.

Cloning the Repo
----------------

* Clone the `treeherder repo`_ from Github.

Running the web-server
----------------------

* Install `Node.js`_ if not present.
* Open a shell, cd into the root of the repository you just cloned and type:

  .. code-block:: bash

     cp ui/js/config/sample.local.conf.js ui/js/config/local.conf.js
     ./web-server.js

Viewing the UI
--------------

Once the server is running, you can navigate to:
`<http://localhost:8000>`_

Configuration
=============

The sample configuration makes the UI load job/push data from the production service API. If you wish to test the UI against stage/dev's service instead, adjust ``thServiceDomain`` in the config file created as part of installation:
``ui/js/config/local.conf.js``

If you wish to run the full treeherder Vagrant project (service + UI), remember to remove local.conf.js or else change ``thServiceDomain`` within it to refer to ``vagrant``, so the UI will use the local Vagrant service API.

Validating JavaScript
=====================

We run our JavaScript code in the frontend through eslint_ to ensure
that new code has a consistent style and doesn't suffer from common
errors. Before submitting a patch, check that your code passes these tests.

* If you haven't already done so, install local dependencies by running ``npm install`` from the project root. Then run ``npm install -g grunt-cli`` as root, so that grunt is added to the global path.
* Run ``grunt checkjs``. You will see errors if your code has problems

.. _eslint: http://eslint.org/

Running the unit tests
======================

The unit tests for the UI are run with Karma_. To do this:

* If you haven't already done so, install local dependencies by running ``npm install`` from the project root. Then run ``npm install -g karma-cli`` as root, so that Karma is added to the global path.
* Then run the following command to execute the tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tests/ui/scripts/test.sh
