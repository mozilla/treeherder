Installation
============

You can work on the UI without needing a VM, by using web-server.js.
There are a few limitations, such as login not being available, but it works well enough for quick testing. For instructions on how to serve the UI with working URL rewriting, see the Vagrant instructions.

Cloning the Repo
----------------

* Clone the `treeherder repo`_ from Github.

Running the web-server
----------------------

* Install `Node.js`_ if not present.
* `npm install` to install all dependencies.
* Open a shell, cd into the root of the repository you just cloned and type:

  .. code-block:: bash

     ./web-server.js

Viewing the UI
--------------

Once the server is running, you can navigate to:
`<http://localhost:8000>`_

Configuration
=============

By default, the web server will serve data from treeherder production. If you wish to test the UI against treeherder stage instead, type:

  .. code-block:: bash

     ./web-server.js --stage

If you wish to test the UI against a custom service, type:

  .. code-block:: bash

     ./web-server.js --server <url>


Please note that if ``ui/js/config/local.conf.js`` exists, the above configuration will be overwritten by ``thServiceDomain`` in the config file.

If you wish to run the full treeherder Vagrant project (service + UI), remember to remove local.conf.js or else change ``thServiceDomain`` within it to refer to ``vagrant``, so the UI will use the local Vagrant service API.

Validating JavaScript
=====================

We run our JavaScript code in the frontend through eslint_ to ensure
that new code has a consistent style and doesn't suffer from common
errors. Before submitting a patch, check that your code passes these tests.

* If you haven't already done so, install local dependencies by running ``npm install`` from the project root. Then run ``npm install -g grunt-cli`` as root, so that grunt is added to the global path.
* Run ``grunt checkjs``. You will see errors if your code has problems

.. _eslint: http://eslint.org/

Running the unit tests
======================

The unit tests for the UI are run with Karma_. To do this:

* If you haven't already done so, install local dependencies by running ``npm install`` from the project root. Then run ``npm install -g karma-cli`` as root, so that Karma is added to the global path.
* Then run the following command to execute the tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tests/ui/scripts/test.sh

.. _Karma: http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/config/configuration-file.html
.. _treeherder repo: https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder
.. _Node.js: http://nodejs.org/download/
